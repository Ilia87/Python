##Use for, .split(), and if to create a Statement that will print out words that start with 's':

# st = 'Print only the words that start with s in this sentence'
# lst = []
# lsts = []
# for i in st.split(" "):
#    lst.append(i)
# for w in lst:
#     if "s" in w[0]:
#         lsts.append(w)
#
# print(lst)
# print(lsts)
#
# # Recomendation
# for word in st.split(" "):
#     if word[0] == "s":
#         print(word)

# Use range() to print all the even numbers from 0 to 10.

for n in range(0, 12, 2):
    print(n)
